Ok so here is a little update - I now have it working. 
Here are some of things  I worked through to get this going in Ubuntu 18.04

1.) You can skip adding the openvpn repository
-Simply start by running the following:

sudo apt-get install openvpn openvpn-systemd-resolved

2.) Skip creating the openvpn@openvpn.service script in /etc/systemd/system/
3.) For the .conf file in /etc/openvpn a few changes need to be made in order for DNS to work properly as Ubuntu 18.04 not longer uses update-resolv-conf

-The end of the openvpn.conf file used to look like this:

#up and down scripts to be executed when VPN starts or stops
#up /etc/openvpn/iptables.sh
#down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf

-Now it is going to look like THIS instead:

#up and down scripts to be executed when VPN starts or stops
up /etc/openvpn/iptables.sh
down /etc/openvpn/update-systemd-resolved
down-pre

# prevent DNS leakage
dhcp-option DOMAIN-ROUTE .

4.)TWO changes need to be made to the /etc/openvpn/routing.sh

A.) ifconfig is deprecated is 18.04 so we need to change the reference to ifconfig to   the more modern method, ip address show

-The old part of the routing.sh config USED to look like this:

GATEWAYIP=$(ifconfig $VPNIF | egrep -o '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' | egrep -v '255|(127\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3})' | tail -n1)
if [[ `ip rule list | grep -c 0x1` == 0 ]]; then
ip rule add from all fwmark 0x1 lookup $VPNUSER
fi

This section of the config should now be changed to THIS:

GATEWAYIP=$(ip address show $VPNIF | egrep -o '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' | egrep -v '255|(127\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3})' | tail -n1)
if [[ `ip rule list | grep -c 0x1` == 0 ]]; then
ip rule add from all fwmark 0x1 lookup $VPNUSER
fi

**NOTE** If for some reason you prefer ifconfig you can still install this using 
sudo apt-get install net-tools. However, I would not suggest this as this 
method was officially deprecated in 2009. 

B.) The method for setting the VPN DNS at the end of the routing.sh script needs to be modified as well to use the new update-system-resolved method

-The section USED to look like this:

# run update-resolv-conf script to set VPN DNS
/etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf

-The section will NOW look like THIS:

# run update-resolv-conf script to set VPN DNS
/etc/openvpn/update-systemd-resolved

5.)In order to set the openvpn.conf to start automatically with the system do the following:

sudo nano /etc/default/openvpn

Remove the "#" comment from the line AUTOSTART

REBOOT

6.)The command for checking if VPN DNS is configured properly will not return what is indicated in the guide. 

-Instead it will always return the following:

# This file is managed by man:systemd-resolved(8). Do not edit.
#
# This is a dynamic resolv.conf file for connecting local clients to the
# internal DNS stub resolver of systemd-resolved. This file lists all
# configured search domains.
#
# Run "systemd-resolve --status" to see details about the uplink DNS servers
# currently in use.
#
# Third party programs must not access this file directly, but only through the
# symlink at /etc/resolv.conf. To manage man:resolv.conf(5) in a different way,
# replace this symlink by a static file or a different symlink.
#
# See man:systemd-resolved.service(8) for details about the supported modes of
# operation for /etc/resolv.conf.

nameserver 127.0.0.53

-Ihe command to check VPN DNS should be systemd-resolve --status
The output of the command will be similar to the following:

Link 4 (tun0)
      Current Scopes: DNS
       LLMNR setting: yes
MulticastDNS setting: no
      DNSSEC setting: no
    DNSSEC supported: no
         DNS Servers: 209.222.18.222
                      209.222.18.218
          DNS Domain: ~.

7.) That's it!!! Following the rest of the guide for Ubuntu 16.04 should get you to where you need to be. 
The changes outlined here have had me up and running with VPN split tunneling on Ubuntu 18.04 reliably (Fingers Crossed). 
This stuff is really not my forte so if there is some glaring oversight on my part please let me know. 
I hope this helps someone else out.
